This is a modern and sleek website template crafted for my DevOps portfolio work. I have deployed it for a DevOps project using Jenkins, SOnarQube, Docker, Github Webhooks, and AWS.

# Project Description: CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, GitHub, SonarQube, and Docker

Robust CI/CD pipeline that automates the software delivery process, ensuring efficient and reliable deployment of applications. The pipeline leverages several powerful tools including Jenkins, GitHub, SonarQube, and Docker to streamline development workflow.

The heart of the pipeline lies in its integration with GitHub. Through GitHub webhooks, the pipeline is triggered automatically whenever a user pushes code to a repository or creates a pull request. This seamless integration allows for immediate feedback and enables the team to continuously deliver code changes.

Once triggered, Jenkins takes over and orchestrates the entire build and deployment process. The pipeline incorporates various stages and checks to ensure code quality and reliability. The first step involves static code analysis, performed using SonarQube. This analysis assesses the code against a set of defined rules, checking for potential bugs, vulnerabilities, and maintainability issues. If the code successfully passes the static code analysis, the pipeline proceeds to the next stage.

In the deployment phase, the pipeline leverages Docker to containerize the application. Docker provides an isolated and consistent runtime environment, making it easier to manage dependencies and ensure consistent deployment across different environments. The pipeline builds the Docker image and deploys it, creating an instance of the application that is ready to run.

To make the application available to end users, the pipeline exposes the deployed app on a designated port. This allows users to access and interact with the application seamlessly, providing a smooth user experience.

By automating the entire process, this CI/CD pipeline significantly reduces manual effort, minimizes the risk of errors, and enables fast and reliable application deployment. It empowers developers to focus on writing quality code while ensuring efficient collaboration and continuous delivery of software updates.
