This is a modern and sleek website template crafted for my DevOps portfolio work. I have deployed it for a DevOps project using Jenkins, SOnarQube, Docker, Github Webhooks, and AWS

This project was developed with HTML5, Sass, jQuery, and Hammer.js.

Performance basics are covered: assets are minified into single CSS and JS files, and the images are optimized.
