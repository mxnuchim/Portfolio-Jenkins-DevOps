# [Global: HTML5 and SASS Portfolio Website]

This is a modern and sleek website template crafted for my DevOps portfolio work. I am using it for a DevOps project where I deploy it using Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker and AWS

This project was developed with HTML5, Sass, jQuery, and Hammer.js.

Performance basics are covered: assets are minified into single CSS and JS files, and the images are optimized.
